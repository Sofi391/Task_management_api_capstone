A **production-ready Inventory Management REST API** built with Django and Django REST Framework.  
The system provides **secure authentication**, **inventory & stock control**, and **advanced business analytics and reporting** for small to medium-sized businesses.

This project was designed and implemented as a **capstone-level backend system**, focusing on clean architecture, performance, and real-world business logic.
This API is designed to be easily extended into a full-stack production system.

## ✨ Motivation

This project was built to simulate a **real-world inventory and sales management system** used by businesses to:

- Track products and stock levels
- Manage purchases and sales transactions
- Monitor staff performance
- Analyze revenue, costs, profit, and trends over time

The goal was to go beyond CRUD and implement **meaningful business reports**, **financial summaries**, and **analytics dashboards** that reflect how real production systems operate.

## 🧩 Project Structure

The project is organized into three main apps:

- **accounts**  
  Handles authentication, JWT, and user management.

- **task_api**  
  Core business logic: products, sales, purchases, and inventory operations.

- **reports**  
  Advanced analytics, summaries, performance reports, and trends.

This separation ensures **scalability**, **maintainability**, and clean responsibility boundaries.
